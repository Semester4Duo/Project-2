## Week 1


### Start

We started the project with empathy maps. We researched our persona’s and would fill these empathy maps with appropriate data for people in this target audience related to the topic. The outcome we were trying to achieve was to give us insight into the problems of our persona’s related to healthcare. Upon completing these maps we had a list of problems we could act on in the define phase.


### First Define

For the first iteration of the define phase, we started with the POV method to define some problems for our persona’s. To dig deeper into these problems and to define them clearly we used the How Might We method. This method helped us to define the root of the problems and to create a problem definition we wanted to tackle.  


### Second Ideation

For the ideation phase, we started with a brainstorm of our problem definition. We did this because we wanted to come up with as many solutions as we could think of for the problem. At the end of the brainstorm, we picked the solution we thought had the most promise. For us, this was an app that helped our persona’s with their sleep.


### Prototyping

We then started with prototyping our app idea. We did this to get a better understanding of which features our app would support and what the design of the app would look like. We used the MoSCoW method to rank our features in importance. We then made a basic wireframe to get a first idea of what our app might look like and get an understanding of the user flow.


## Week 2

We decided to not go through with the sleeping app idea because we didn't think we could bring anything new to our app which hadn’t been done loads of times before. 


### Second Define

We had to come up with a new idea for our project. To do this we went back to the define phase and used a different method that would help us create a different problem definition. We applied the 5W’s method to get to the root of each How Might We question to get a better understanding of what our persona’s problems are.


### Second Ideation

We then reiterated the ideation phase with the lotus flower method which forced us to create a lot of possible solutions for our problem definition. After we finished with the lotus flower method we again picked the solution we thought was most interesting to realize. For us, this was an app that aims to make exercising more fun by creating group activities for its users.

This week we also focussed on the programming part in android studio. We both created a test app in which we would demonstrate a basic understanding of android studio and Kotlin. \



## Week 3


### Feedback

After our feedback moment with John and Marcel we got a lot of feedback to improve our project. We were misunderstanding the design thinking process which led to us limiting our ideation to just what the persona’s wanted. Instead, we should have applied innovation to our topic to come up with ideas and applied our persona’s to these ideas. By doing it this way we had a way bigger range of interesting innovations and problems we could tackle within our topic.


### Third Ideation

To do this we revisited the lotus flower method and filled the lotus flower with innovations and frequent problems within healthcare. This brought us a lot of interesting ideas for us to investigate further. We picked three of these ideas to expand on so we could discuss these with John and Marcel. After this discussion, we came to the conclusion that the e-consultant idea for people with cardiovascular diseases would be the most viable for us. 


### Empathize

For a better understanding of what needs to happen in the app, we started with an interview with a general practitioner. This gave us a lot of insight into what was needed for our app and which challenges we were required to solve. 

We then wanted to explore what our persona’s needed the most of an E-Consultant app by creating empathy maps that explain their experience with the app. We did this so we could cater our experience to our persona’s. 


### Prototyping

We then started to style and design our application to fit our persona’s and the end goal.

When designing we made sure to create an app that is visually clear to the user. To do this we did a lot of things. First, we researched the things we had to keep account of by researching the pillars of UX Design. The first thing that we focussed on was accessibility making sure this was covered since this often gets forgotten. To do this we made sure the contrast between elements isn’t too small. To make sure beforehand that we have enough contrast we chose applicable colors to use in both dark and light modes. Since translations take a long time and are bound to errors, we chose to only include English in our application.

After tackling accessibility we thought about the findability of our app, to do this we made sure the icons we chose fit with the tab names. And also the tab names have been thought of to be as clear as possible. To make sure all information is easily findable there aren’t any deep nested views to be explored; everything is as close as possible.


### Implementation

After beginning the prototype phase we also started implementing the app according to the design we had so far. This is pretty straightforward in the way that we just start programming and see what problems we come by. So far we have finished the tab navigation and the beginning of the home page.


## Week 4

This week is all about programming, because programming can easily be done individually. we thought it was smarter to clearly divide who does what this time.

We came to the following task list:


### Tab Bar:



* Dylan made the Tab Bar


### Home Page:



* Because Dylan had done the appbar relatively early, he also made the header and appointment message on this page. 
* The rest of the page was made by David


### Profile Page:



* David made the profile page


### Check-Up Page:



* Dylan made the Check-Up page


### Lifestyle Page:



* Dylan made the Lifestyle page
